## Usage
Install Virtualbox, Vagrant, and Postman.

Clone the project, and write `vagrant up`. Then it should set up project to use.

### [Audit video](https://youtu.be/cGk-uWAe7fs)
- In the video, I skipped vm setup with vagrant, because it takes around 5-10 minutes to run that command.

If you have any questions about the task, feel free to ask me.
